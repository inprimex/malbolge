# Symbolizm of this Project

- Malbolge is the most complicated programming language in the world, and this single-line, 288-character project represents that the war in Ukraine will have ended. 

- This language has only eight operations, representing our limited resources and external constraints in this war against russia.

- Malbolge is an esoteric programming language that utilizes self-modifying code and encryption-like transformations, making it extraordinarily difficult to program. This represents our internal challenges that nobody external can resolve, but we should do it.

...but all these constraints, challenges, and extraordinary difficulties anyway will have only one result!
